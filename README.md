# LSTM Neural Network for Time Series Prediction - for SBER

LSTM built using the Keras Python package to predict time series steps and sequences. For SBER stock market data.

My realization for SBER price prediction.

#### We need to normalize data properly in order to get right prediction.

We can use multi dimensional data input for our model.

#### Please be aware! This model is only DRAFT - not real for stock price predictions.

Wait for the next video with the Full review of structure for model.

How to get stock data in real time: [see this code](https://github.com/WISEPLAT/shares_get_history_class)

Jupyter Notebook with some of this code is [here](https://github.com/WISEPLAT/_NN).
